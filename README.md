# Visual Collection Manager

Visual Collection Manager is a Python desktop application designed to help users organize and browse their collections of images and visual assets. It provides an intuitive interface for creating collections, assigning tags, and managing visual content stored in local folders.

## Features

*   **Create New Collections:** Easily add new collections with a dedicated name, folder path, and cover image.
*   **Tagging System:** Assign multiple tags to collections for better organization and filtering (tags are displayed as colored boxes on collection cards).
*   **Dynamic Collection Display:** Collections are displayed as cards in a grid layout, showing a preview image (16:9 aspect ratio), name, and tags.
*   **Folder & Image Selection:** Built-in file choosers to select folders and images for collections.
*   **Persistent Storage:** Collection and tag data are stored locally in an SQLite database.
*   **Responsive UI Elements:** Card heights adjust to content, and image previews maintain a consistent aspect ratio.
*   **Open Collection Folders:** Quickly open the folder associated with a collection directly from the application.
